Story:
setup face information
    You're in some confined situation.
    Encounter a mystic needle-insect stinger critter.
    He offers to give you a face-tattoo of some powerful secret:
        "You have gold?"
        "Yes!" You rummage in your pockets for a while until you emerge, triumphant, with a single smudged gold piece between thumb and finger.
        "OoOoH" - its mandibles chitter - "Give! Mine!"
        "No. You tell me how to get out of here."
        "Fine." It mutters. "We make deal. You give gold. I write how."
        You hand the gold over.
        It giggles and launches itself at the frostbitten flesh of your left cheek, mincing it with its florescent stinger in a hail of a thousand tiny stabs.
        A fucking face tattoo.
        And no mirror.
